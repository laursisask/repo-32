# Build a better document solution 

Use InDesign’s suite of Plug-in, Scripting and Server SDKs, to fully extend and automate InDesign, InCopy, and InDesign Server. Distribute your plug-ins to everyone using Adobe Exchange. <br /><br /> With scripts leverage the power of InDesign to streamline editorial and publishing workflows of your users

### Integrate with other apps

InDesign supports the Adobe Common Extensibility Platform (CEP), which lets you build scripts and panels that connect InDesign to other Adobe apps. Automate entire multi-app workflows.

### Import, export, and process documents in XML-compatible format 

Use InDesign’s IDML, an XML-based format, to manipulate documents and their contents. Process files for import and export, or read and write content to databases.

### Automate and add features with scripting
